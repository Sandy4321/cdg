# Concept Drift and Anomaly Detection in a Sequence of Graphs

The cdg module is the reference code for most of my publications. 
Please find a detailed description of the procedures these: [tnnls17], [ijcnn18] and [ssci17]. Some demostrations are also available.


## The module

The code is written in `python 3`. 
In the module you will find following folders
* **`cdg/graph`** interface for datasets of graphs and dissimilarities.
* **`cdg/embedding`** several types of numeric representations of graphs, such as, dissimilarity representation and manifold embeddings [tnnls17, ijcnn18]. 
* **`cdg/changedetection`** tests for concept drift (change) detection [tnnls17].
* **`cdg/util`** utilities for the module.
* **`cdg/simulation`** simulates a sequence of graphs and applies detection tests.

You will then find some scripts (`scritps`), e.g., to aggregate results, and code snippets (`demo`).


## Requirements 

You may need the `graph-matching-toolkit` [1] (available [here](https://github.com/dan-zam/graph-matching-toolkit)) and `graphviz` [2].
A good place to locate the `graph-matching-toolkit` is `./graph-matching-toolkit/graph-matching-toolkit.jar`.

## Installation

Go to your preferred directory, then 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dan-zam/cdg
cd cdg
sudo pip3 install -e .
```
