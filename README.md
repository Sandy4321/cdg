## Package description ##

The package is the reference code for the publications [1] and [2]. As such it implements the method and the code for runnig the experiments therein described. 
Please consider paper [1] for citations.

The code is written in `python` language and has been runned on a `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS` machine with python `3.5.2`.
The package is composed of `cdg` module, some scripts (`./scritps/`) and demos (`./demo/`).

### `cdg` Module ###

The module is composed of four files:

* **`graph.py`** interface for graph instances and some functionalities for computing features and finding graph prototypes.
* **`changedetection.py`** change detection tests.
* **`database.py`** interface for different datasets. 
* **`simulation.py`** pipeline of the change detection tests on stream of graphs presented in [1] .

### Script ###

See the help

```python3 ./scripts/process_results.py -h```


### Demo ###

See the help

```python3 ./demo/demo.py -h```

## Requirements ##

### Python libraries ###
You will need the following python3 packages:

* system: `sys`, `os`, `subprocess`, `pickle`, `datetime`
* numerical: `random`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `random`
* graphical: `matplotlib`
* graph: `pydotplus`, `xml`


### Other toolkits ###

Other required packages are:

* graph edit distance: `GraphMatchingToolkit` [3] (available here [graph-matching-toolkit](https://github.com/dan-zam/graph-matching-toolkit)).
* graph visualisation: `graphviz` [4].
